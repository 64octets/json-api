title: "JSON API: Specification Status"
---

JSON API is at a fourth release candidate state.

This is the final release candidate before the specification will be tagged
1.0 on May 28, 2015.

In the final week before 1.0, do not expect any changes to the specified
document structure. This release candidate exists solely to provide time for
the specification to be carefully reviewed for inconsistencies and defects.

Libraries intended to work with 1.0 should implement this version of the
specification as soon as possible.

Work on this specification is being done at its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/json-api/json-api). Please feel free to help
flesh it out or, if you try to write an implementation, to tell us where things
were ambiguous. The best way to do so is to [file an
Issue](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues).
